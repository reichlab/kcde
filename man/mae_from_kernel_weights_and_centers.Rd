\title{Compute MASE from predictions that are in the form of kernel weights and
centers.  This is currently broken because we need predictions for a whole
time series to compute MASE, and the current "implementation" only takes
values for one time point.
Compute "mean" absolute error for one time point from prediction in the form
of kernel weights and centers.}
\usage{
mae_from_kernel_weights_and_centers(kernel_weights_and_centers, obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{kernel_weights_and_centers}{a named list with two components: weights
is a vector of kernel weights, and centers is a vector of kernel centers}

\item{obs}{is a numeric with length 1 containing the observed value for one
time point}
}
\value{
abs(obs - prediction) where prediction is the weighted mean of the
    kernel centers.
